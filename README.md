# 🚗 Smart Parking Space Detector using Python & OpenCV

A computer vision-based parking space detection system built with Python and OpenCV. This project uses a video feed of a parking lot and identifies which spaces are occupied and which are available — all in real time.

## 🎯 Features

- 🔍 Detects empty and occupied parking spots
- 🎥 Works with both live camera feed or video files
- 🧠 Position tracking with pre-defined parking zones
- ✅ Visual indicators for each space (green = free, red = taken)
- 🖼️ Includes sample video and static image input
- 🗂️ Parking position coordinates are saved and re-used
